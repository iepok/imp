# imp

**imp** — short for **implement** — is a CLI-first goal tracking and productivity system developed by [iepok.com](https://iepok.com).  

The core philosophy of **imp** is simple: **the user should spend almost zero time in the application** while effortlessly documenting and executing their goals in real time. Everything in **imp** is focused on **implementation** — what cannot or will not be implemented is considered useless.

## Core Philosophy

1. **User Effort Reduction**  
   Every feature exists to **save time and reduce friction**. Users should be able to log, plan, and analyze their actions with minimal interaction.

2. **Minimal Input, Maximal Focused Output**  
   Users provide just what’s necessary; **imp** handles analysis, logging, and suggestions automatically, delivering actionable results immediately.

3. **Implementation-Centric**  
   Only actionable tasks matter. **imp** encourages users to focus on what they can actually implement, not theoretical or incomplete plans.

4. **Real-Time Documentation**  
   Track your actions, goals, and plans instantly. Nothing is lost, and everything is structured for easy review and analysis.

## Philosophy in Practice

- **Cross-platform consistency:** CLI, desktop, mobile, and watch interfaces are unified under the same philosophy.  
- **Automation:** Analysis, logging, and progress tracking are performed automatically whenever possible.  
- **Focus:** Every design decision and feature prioritization is guided by **implementation-first thinking** — if it doesn't help the user **do** something, it doesn't exist.
